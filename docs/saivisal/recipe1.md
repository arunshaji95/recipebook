## Preparation

Clean the beef with turmeric water and add turmeric powder, pepper powder, chilly powder, salt and lemon juice to the beef after draining the water. Keep the beef marinated for 15 minutes and cook it in a pressure cooker for 6 to 7 whistles.

Now add 5 tbsp of coconut oil to a Kadai and deep fry the coconut titbits and keep it aside. Add chopped onions, ginger garlic paste, green chillies and curry leafs one after the other and keep stirring.
Once the onion becomes light brown colour add salt, coriander powder, turmeric powder, Beef ulathu masala, chilly powder and fry it until the raw smell of the masala is gone. After this you can add chopped tomatoes and smash it to make it a paste.

Next add few fennel seeds and sprinkle some garam masala to the paste. Make sure you won't over fry the paste. You may now add the cooked beef to the Kadai and mix it with the paste. 

Cook for another 10 to 15 minutes until the gravy is disappeared. Add the fried coconut titbits and curry leafs. Stir thoroughly so that the content won't stick with the Kadai. Once the beef becomes dark brown in colour you can turn off the fire. 

Finger licking mouth watering Kerala beef roast is now ready. Serve it with soft and crispy layered Porotta.
